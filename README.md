# Retail GeoPlatform
## About
This repository was created as a part of the AI Talent Hackathon. During this hackathon, the problem of analyzing reviews of X5 retail stores was solving. As a solution, we have proposed the *GeoPlatform* - a tool for analyzing reviews both for one store and for a set of stores in a district/city.

## Data collection
The data was collected from open sources such as Yandex Maps and 2GIS. The result of parsing was more than 5,000 reviews of 55 stores of 5 different retail chains.
